Imagine having Satoshi Nakamoto for a father. [http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/03/bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-revealed-after-years-of-mystery/](http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/03/bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-revealed-after-years-of-mystery/) He is your usual cranky old man in his 60s. His supposed daughter had this to say about him:

> 'He is very wary of government interference in general,' she says. 'When I was little, there was a game we used to play. He would say, 'Pretend the government agencies are coming after you.' And I would hide in the closet.'

He was a software engineer for the FAA, has worked on military systems, and has done work for Hughes Aircraft at RCA.
